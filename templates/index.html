              <h3 class="question">What is a Credit Report?</h3>
              <p class="answer">
                A credit report is a detailed record of your credit history, including information on your credit accounts, loans, credit cards, payment history, and any collections. It is used by lenders to assess your creditworthiness when you apply for credit or loans.

              <h3 class="question">What is a Credit Score?</h3>
              <p class="answer">
                A credit score is a numerical expression of your creditworthiness, usually ranging from 300 to 850. It is based on the information in your credit report and helps lenders determine the risk of lending to you. A higher score indicates better creditworthiness.

                2. Request a credit report from a major credit bureau (Experian, Equifax, or TransUnion).<br>

              <h3 class="question">Why is Credit Score Important?</h3>
              <p class="answer">
                Your credit score is important because it influences lenders’ decisions about whether to approve your applications for loans, credit cards, or mortgages. A higher score can lead to better terms, such as lower interest rates, while a lower score can make it more difficult to get credit and result in higher interest rates.

                Credit scores are calculated based on several factors:<br>

                4. Types of Credit Used (10%) - The variety of credit accounts you have (e.g., credit cards, mortgages).<br>

          <h3 class="question">
            Why does my credit score keep changing?
          </h3>
          <p class="answer">
            Your credit score can change due to various factors, such as changes in your credit usage (e.g., increasing your credit card balance), new credit inquiries, changes in your payment history (e.g., missing a payment), or changes in the length of your credit history. Other factors, like the credit mix and recent credit account closures, can also cause fluctuations.

          <h3 class="question">
            What is the minimum score needed in a credit report to get a personal loan? 
          </h3>
          <p class="answer">
            Typically, a score of 650 or higher is needed to get a personal loan, though it can vary depending on the lender and the type of loan. Some lenders may offer loans to individuals with lower scores, but it often comes with higher interest rates. A higher credit score generally helps secure better loan terms.

            Who can access my credit score? 
          </h3>
          <p class="answer">
            Only authorized parties like lenders, creditors, and certain businesses can access your credit score.

          </h3>
          <p class="answer">
            Currently, social media does not directly affect your credit score. However, some lenders or financial institutions may consider your social media activity when making decisions in specific situations, such as assessing your character or stability. Some services may also analyze social media patterns to offer alternative credit assessments in the future.
